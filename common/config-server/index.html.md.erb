## Overview ##

Config Server for [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) is an externalized application configuration service, which gives you a central place to manage an app's external properties across all environments. As an app moves through the deployment pipeline from development to test and into production, you can use Config Server to manage the configuration between environments and be certain that the app has everything it needs to run when you migrate it. Config Server easily supports labelled versions of environment-specific configurations and is accessible to a wide range of tooling for managing the content.

The concepts on both client and server map identically to the Spring `Environment` and `PropertySource` abstractions. They work very well with Spring apps, but can be applied to apps written in any language. The default implementation of the server storage backend uses [Git](./configuring-with-git.html). [HashiCorp Vault](./configuring-with-vault.html) is also supported.

Config Server for Pivotal Cloud Foundry is based on <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html#_spring_cloud_config_server">Spring Cloud Config Server</a>.
