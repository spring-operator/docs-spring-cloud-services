To connect client applications to the Config Server, Spring Cloud Services uses [Spring Cloud Connectors](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-connectors.html), including the [Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/spring-cloud-cloud-foundry-connector.html), which discovers services bound to applications running in Cloud Foundry.

## <a id="service-detection"></a>Service Detection

The connector inspects Cloud Foundry's `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, which stores connection and identification information for service instances that are bound to Cloud Foundry applications, to detect available services. Below is an example of a `VCAP_SERVICES` entry for the Spring Cloud Services Config Server.

```json
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "p-config-server": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "access_token_uri": "https://p-spring-cloud-services.uaa.cf.wise.com/oauth/token",
     "client_id": "p-config-server-c4a56a3d-9507-4c2f-9cd1-f858dbf9e11c",
     "client_secret": "9aGx9K5Vx0cM",
     "uri": "https://config-51711835-4626-4823-b5a1-e5d91012f3f2.wise.com"
    },
    "label": "p-config-server",
    "name": "config-server",
    "plan": "standard",
    "tags": [
     "configuration",
     "spring-cloud"
    ]
   }
  ]
```

For each service in the `VCAP_SERVICES` variable, the connector considers the following fields:

* `tags`: Attributes or names of backing technologies behind the service.
* `label`: The service offering's name (not to be confused with a service _instance's_ name).
* `credentials.uri`: A URI pertaining to the service instance.
* `credentials.uris`: URIs pertaining to the service instance.

### <a id="config-server-detection-criteria"></a>Config Server Detection Criteria

To establish availability of the Config Server, the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Connector compares `VCAP_SERVICES` service entries against the following criteria:

* `tags` including `configuration`

## <a id="application-configuration"></a>Application Configuration

When the connector detects a Config Server service instance which has been bound to the application, it will automatically set the ```spring.cloud.config.uri``` property in the client application's environment, using the URL provided in the Config Server instance's ```credentials``` object. The connector will also set additional security properties to allow the client application to access the Config Server service instance.

### <a id="hashicorp-vault-token-renewal"></a>HashiCorp Vault Token Renewal

When the `spring.cloud.config.token` property is set on an application, the connector enables automatic token renewal for a HashiCorp Vault client token. By default, the token's Time To Live (TTL) is set at 300000 milliseconds and the connector automatically renews the application's token every 60000 milliseconds.

You can configure the token's TTL and the renewal interval using properties under `vault.token`, set in the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file. The TTL is set using the `vault.token.ttl` property and the renewal interval is set using the `vault.token.renew.rate` property.

The following YAML sets the token TTL to 600000 milliseconds (10 minutes) and sets the renewal interval to 180000 milliseconds (three minutes).

```yml
vault:
  token:
    ttl: 600000
    renew:
      rate: 180000 
```

### <a id="hashicorp-vault-property-source-redaction"></a>HashiCorp Vault Property Source Redaction

In the Spring Boot Actuator `env` endpoint, property names and values from a HashiCorp Vault property source are redacted for security. By default, the connector redacts properties whose names begin with `configService:vault:`, and they are displayed in the output of `env` as shown in the following example:

```
"configService:vault:game": {
    "******": "Properties from this source are redacted for security reasons"
},
```

You can configure the pattern used to determine which properties to redact, as well as the message displayed in place of those properties' values, using properties set in the `application.yml` or `application.properties` file. The pattern is set using the `endpoints.env.mask.sourceNamePatterns` property (wildcards, written as `*`, are allowed) and the message is set using the `endpoints.env.mask.message` property.

For example, the following YAML sets the redacted property name pattern to match property sources whose names begin with `configService:` and sets the message to `Redacted for security`.

```yml
endpoints:
  env:
    mask: 
      sourceNamePatterns: "configService:"
      message: "Redacted for security"
```
